I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Communication at Nanjing University (advised by [Dr. Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjun.github.io/)). I am also an active member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). On a personal note, my boyfriend, Yuewen Zhong, is a Ph.D. student specializing in Particle Physics at Fudan University.

My primary research interests lie in Computational Communication, Social Impacts and Digital Humanities. Methodologically, I can analyze human behaviors using large-scale digital footprint data. I excel in Python and take good command of R and Stata, basically on text mining, statistical analysis, natural language processing, machine learning and causal inference. Recently, I have employed quantitative methods to explore the impact of conflicts as exogenous shocks on intercultural communication. My master's thesis aims to investigate the inner-party dissent using diachronic tweets of Congressmen and congressional voting data.

Apart from the above, I have been actively leading various side projects. One of these projects involves studying the social relationship between users and ChatGPT. As a Principal Investigator (_PI_), I have also done several research designs, including but not limited to (1) The Impact of Social Time Use on the Experienced Well-being of the Elderly, (2) Is Local Media News Delocalizing? An Empirical Evidence, (3) First Impression: Predicting User Personality Using Instagram Profile Picture.

Beyond my academic and research interests, I am also proficient in image processing and video editing, with a strong sense of aesthetics. Furthermore, I hold a Piano Level 8 Certificate, reflecting my dedication to both creative and artistic endeavors.
