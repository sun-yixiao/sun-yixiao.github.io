Hi! My name is Xinya Jiang (姜新雅). I am a second-year M.A. student in the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University, advised by [Dr. Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjun.github.io/). I am a member of [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). I obtained my B.A. in Journalism from Nanjing University.

I am interested in political communication, computational social science, and social media studies. More specifically, my on-going research focus on the following questions: (1) What’s the effects of media on political polarization and what’s the consequences? (2) Do Algorithms and social interactions on social media aggravate opinion polarization and political polarization? (3) How powerful are narratives and emotions on social media? Do they promote the spread of hate speech and counter-speech?

I am interested in computational methods and quantitative methods. I usually use large-scale data on social media and survey data. I also want to try experiments in the future.

I have a white Samoyed dog named Laifu (来福, Meaning: Happiness comes to our family). She now lives happily in Huai’an, Jiangsu, where I was born and raised. In my spare time, I like bodybuilding and watching movies. *Daisy*, *The Lord of the Rings*, *Star Wars*, and *Mission: Impossible* are my favorite ones.
