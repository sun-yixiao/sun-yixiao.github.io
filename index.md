I am a first-year PhD student at the [Department of Communication, College of Communication Arts and Sciences, Michigan State University](https://comartsci.msu.edu/departments/communication), advised by [Dr. David M. Markowitz](https://www.davidmarkowitz.org/). My research primarily lies at the intersection of **computational psycholinguistics** and **political communication**, with a focus on how communicative materials shape societal institutions and influence individual mental states and behaviors.

Methodologically, I specialize in analyzing human behavior through large-scale digital footprint data. I am proficient in Python and highly skilled in R, particularly for applications in statistical modeling, natural language processing, and causal inference.

As a computational psycholinguistic researcher, I aim to push the boundaries of computational methods by developing new frameworks for analyzing complex elements of human communication—such as _identity_, _context_, _narrative_, and _rhetoric_—and by tracing how these elements reveal the evolving dynamics of people’s psychology and behavior.

My work has been published in leading journals, including the _Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media_, _International Journal of Business Communication_, _Chinese Journal of Communication_ and _Communication and the Public_. My research has been supported by four internal and external grants, and recognized with two academic honors from the National Communication Association: the [Top Paper Award](/assets/awards/nca24_pld.jpg) from the Political Communication Division and the [Top Student Paper Award](/assets/awards/nca24_hctd.jpg) from the Human Communication and Technology Division.
