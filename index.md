I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Communication at Nanjing University (advised by [Dr. Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjun.github.io/)). I am also an active member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/).

My primary research interests lie in Computational Communication, specifically focusing on Computational Narratives and their Social Impacts. Methodologically, I can analyze human behaviors using large-scale digital footprint data. I excel in Python and take good command of R and Stata, basically on text mining, statistical analysis, natural language processing, machine learning and causal inference. Recently, I have employed quantitative methods to explore the impact of conflicts as exogenous shocks on intercultural communication. My master's thesis aims to investigate the dissent voting behavior using diachronic tweets of Congressmen and congressional roll call voting data. Four internal and external grants have funded my research.

In addition to the aforementioned projects, I have been actively leading several side projects. One paper focuses on the social relationships between individuals and ChatGPT, while the other explores the dynamics of authoritarian personalities during COVID-19 pandemic. Both papers have completed the writing process and are now ready to enter the peer review stage.

Beyond my academic and research interests, I am also proficient in image processing and video editing, with a strong sense of aesthetics. Furthermore, I hold a Piano Level 8 Certificate, reflecting my dedication to both creative and artistic endeavors.
