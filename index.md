I am currently a M.A. student in Communication at Nanjing University (advised by [Dr. Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjun.github.io/)), as well as member of [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). My boyfriend is Yuewen Zhong, Ph.D. student in Physics (Particle Physics) at Fudan University.

My research interest is Computational Communication, Social Impacts and Digital Humanities. Methodologically, I can analyze human behaviors using large-scale digital footprint data. I do well in Python and take good command of R and Stata, basically on text mining, statistical analysis, natural language processing, machine learning and causal inference. Recently, I have been fascinated with Quantitative History Studies. I use quantitative methods to study the impact of conflicts (as exogenous shocks) on intercultural communication. My master's thesis is expected to study the inner-party dissent using diachronic tweets of Congressmen and congressional voting data.

Apart from the above, my side projects include a paper about the impact of perceived Chatbot digital companionship on willingness of social interaction. As a _PI_, I have also done several research designs, including but not limited to (1) The Impact of Social Time Use on the Experienced Well-being of the Elderly, (2) Is Local Media News Delocalizing?: An Empirical Evidence, (3) First Impression: Predicting User Personality Using Instagram Profile Picture.

Besides, I am proficient in image processing and video editting with great aesthetic. In addition, I possess Piano Level 8 Certificate.
