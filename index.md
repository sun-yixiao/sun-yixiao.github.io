I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Communication at Nanjing University (advised by [Prof. Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjun.github.io/)). I am also an active member of the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/). **I will be joining the Department of Communication at Michigan State University for doctoral studies in the Fall 2025.**

My research primarily focuses on computational psycholinguistics, using computational methods to examine how communicative materials influence both societal institutions and individual mental states and behaviors. Methodologically, I can analyze human behaviors using large-scale digital footprint data. I excel in Python and take good command of R programming language, basically on mathematical statistics, natural language processing, and causal inference. 

My work has been published in the _Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media_, _International Journal of Business Communication_, _Chinese Journal of Communication_ and _Communication and the Public_ journals. Four external and internal grants have funded my research. Additionally, I have received two awards from the National Communication Association for my research: the [Top Paper Award](/assets/awards/nca24_pld.jpg) from the Political Communication Division and the [Top Student Paper Award](/assets/awards/nca24_hctd.jpg) from the Human Communication and Technology Division.
