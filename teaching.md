**_Text Data Analysis_** (Graduate lecture; Instructor: [Dr. Zhicong Chen](https://zhicongchen.github.io/))

**_Planning and Creative Strategy_** (Graduate seminar; Instructor: [Dr. Zhihao Ma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhihao-Ma-2))

- Feedbacks from my students:
  - _"Yixiao lectures very clearly. We are lucky to have her!"_
  - _"Yixiao always pinpoints and clearly explains the issues in our project, and I find her presence reassuring."_
  - _"I think Yixiao is really talented and takes good command of coding!"_

**_Advertising Strategy & Creation_** (Undergraduate lecture; Instructor: [Dr. Zhihao Ma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhihao-Ma-2))

- Feedbacks from my students:
  - _"Yixiao is excellent! Thanks to her for sharing the word frequency analysis code and research methods, and I feel that her academics are very strong!"_
  - _"Yixiao is really nice! She answers any questions in a timely and detailed manner, and will remind us of details and make encouragement 
 when assigning tasks. She is perfect!"_
  - _"Yixiao is beyond admiration."_


#### **Teaching Resources**

---

As a teaching assistant, I developed numerous codes for my students, explaining their functionality and demonstrating how to run them in class. Below are some representative utilities I offer:

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**: Explaining the principles and functions of the Bag-of-Words model and the TF-IDF method, I demonstrated how to apply them when processing text data. Additionally, I also introduced two distinct approaches for preprocessing English and Chinese corpora. -> [_BoW_Tfidf_eng.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/BoW_Tfidf_eng.ipynb) for English corpora and [_BoW_Tfidf_chn.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/BoW_Tfidf_chn.ipynb) for Chinese corpora

**Social Media Data Sampling and Crawling**

- **Random Digit Search (RDS)**: Following the approach of Zhu et al. [(2011)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439310382512), an estimation is made for the actual user population of NetEase Cloud Music. -> [_music163_RDS.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/music163_RDS.ipynb)


#### **Other Resources to Share**

---

Outside of my work as a teaching assistant, I will periodically share methodological insights I have acquired during my research. My aim is to actively engage with other individuals interested in computational social science and quantitative research. Below are some items that may be useful:

- Using R language to conduct [Bootstrapping method](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/discussions/2)
- Performing ANOVA analysis to calculate [effect size](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/discussions/3) on panel data across multiple time points using R language
