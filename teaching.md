#### **Teaching Resources**

---

As a teaching assistant, I developed numerous codes for my students, explaining their functionality and demonstrating how to run them in class. Below are some representative utilities I offer:

**Multimodal Analysis**

- **Face Cognition**: I analyzed the face marks within the images and calculated various facial features based on these marks. -> [_Face_Cognition.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Face_Cognition.ipynb)

- **Color Analysis**: I replicated the research methodology of Tager et al. [(2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/col.22638), demonstrating how to convert an RGB image into an HSV image based on the Munsell Color System and analyzing the proportion of specific color type pixels within the entire image. -> [_Color_Analysis.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Color_Analysis.ipynb)

- **Audio Analysis**: I analyzed the audio for tempo and loudness using the librosa package. -> [_Audio_Analysis.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Audio_Analysis.ipynb)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **Narrative Structure**: Based on the insights provided by Toubia et al. [(2021)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011695118), I developed a code to measure the _speed_, _volume_, and _circuitousness_ of narratives. -> [_Narrative_Structure.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Narrative_Structure.ipynb)

- **Word Embedding Model**: I explained the principles and functions of the Word Embedding model, demonstrated how to train or call the model, and used PCA to reduce the semantic space to two dimensions for visualizing the relative positions of word vectors. -> [_Word_Embedding.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Word_Embedding.ipynb) or [_Word_Embedding_Update.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Word_Embeeding_Update.ipynb)

- **Moral Lexicon**: I utilized both the English Moral Foundations Dictionary (eMFD) by Hopp et al. [(2021)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01433-0) and the Chinese Moral Foundations Dictionary (C-MFD) by Cheng and Zhang [(2023)](https://doi.org/10.5117/CCR2023.2.10.CHEN), grounded in Moral Foundation Theory (Graham et al., [2009](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0015141)), to analyze the moral characteristics present in the corpus. -> [_Moral_Lexicon.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Moral_Lexicon.ipynb)

- **Emotion Lexicon**: I employed both the NRC Emotion Lexicon (English and Chinese) and the DLUT Emotion Lexicon (Chinese) to analyze the emotional characteristics present in the corpus. -> [_Emotion_Lexicon.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/Emotion_Lexicon.ipynb)

- **LDA Model**: I developed a classic LDA topic analysis algorithm and created an interactive visualization to present the results. -> [_LDA.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/LDA.ipynb)

- **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**: Explaining the principles and functions of the Bag-of-Words model and the TF-IDF method, I demonstrated how to apply them when processing text data. Additionally, I also introduced two distinct approaches for preprocessing English and Chinese corpora. -> [_BoW_Tfidf_eng.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/BoW_Tfidf_eng.ipynb) for English corpora and [_BoW_Tfidf_chn.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/BoW_Tfidf_chn.ipynb) for Chinese corpora

**Social Media Data Sampling and Crawling**

- **Random Digit Search (RDS)**: Following the approach of Zhu et al. [(2011)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439310382512), an estimation is made for the actual user population of NetEase Cloud Music. -> [_music163_RDS.ipynb_](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/blob/main/music163_RDS.ipynb)


#### **Other Resources to Share**

---

Outside of my work as a teaching assistant, I will periodically share methodological insights I have acquired during my research. My aim is to actively engage with other individuals interested in computational social science and quantitative research. Below are some items that may be useful:

- Using R language to conduct [Bootstrapping method](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/discussions/2)
- Performing ANOVA analysis to calculate [effect size](https://github.com/sun-yixiao/teaching/discussions/3) on panel data across multiple time points using R language
